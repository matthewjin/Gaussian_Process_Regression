* To Do
** Figure out why it doesn't scale well:
   When range = [1, 4], things get messed up
** Figure out why x needs to be sorted when updating
   When unsorted, things get messed up
** Figure out why all functions requires the same number of iterations
   Surely, depending on the function, the simpler the function,
   the faster it should terminate?
** Figure out how to do kernel estimation. Maybe that answers everything.
** Figure out how to do noisy GP. 
   Currently, it's not really performing properly
